        In a real scenario, this would involve:
        1. Undistorting the image using camera calibration parameters.
        2. Identifying the object of interest (e.g., using segmentation or edge detection).
        3. Calculating real-world dimensions from pixel measurements using the camera matrix.
        4. Comparing with nominal dimensions to detect deviations.

        Args:
            image_path (str): Path to the image containing the object.
            object_pixels (list): List of pixel coordinates (e.g., [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]) defining the object.
            real_world_unit_per_pixel (float, optional): If provided, a simplified measurement can be done.
                                                         Otherwise, full camera calibration is needed.
        Returns:
